## Subject: Liminal space

### What is the definition of liminal(ity)?

The phrase "liminal", as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd edition), refers to a state of being on the edge or **==threshold==**, often associated with ==**ambiguity**== and ==**transition**==. It describes a space or condition that is neither one thing nor another, but rather a **==period==** or **==place==** of in-betweenness.

Etymology From the latin "limen" meaning a ==**threshold**==

Types of liminality
- Temporal dimensions (within time, a period)
	- Examples of temporal liminal experiences:
		- Marriage, death, graduation etc
		 According to Victor Turner a/the liminal entity is temporaraly not part of a normalized social structure but is present in a antistructure (Liminality-and-Communitas-by-Victor-Turner)
- Spatial dimensions (within space, a place)
	- Examples of spatial liminal experiences:
		- Hallways, airports, waitingrooms etc 
		- Multiple definitions of liminal spaces, Sharon Zukin and Rob Shields both base their definition of liminal space on the definition of luminality by Victor Turner. 
Both these types separately or combined can be refered to as **liminal experiences**

#### Comparing definitions of Rob Shields and Sharon Zukin on liminal spaces:
##### According to Rob Shields:

“Liminal spaces are marginal… zones of possibility where the norms of behavior, identity, and meaning are suspended.”  
(Places on the Margin, 1991)
###### What is liminality?
Draws directly on **anthropological concepts of liminality** (Turner, van Gennep). Focuses on **transitional, ambiguous spaces** that blur boundaries between places, roles, and meanings.

###### What is a liminal space?
Focuses on **in-between places**: train stations, airports, border zones, urban voids they are spaces of **transition or flux**.

###### What are the key theoretical concerns?
Interested in how **space and identity** are produced in marginal or threshold areas. Liminality allows for **experimentation, ambiguity, and transformation**.

###### What is the impact of such place on social behaviour and control?
Liminal spaces are **loosely regulated**, allowing for **non-normative behaviors**, experimentation, or resistance.

###### What is the meaning of a liminal space?
Emphasizes **spatial ambiguity** which means they contain unclear borders, functions, and symbolic meanings. These spaces are **open-ended**, culturally and socially.


##### According to Sharon Zukin:

“Public space has become a liminal zone — open but controlled, visible but monitored… what is at stake is who has the power to shape its symbolic meaning.”  
(The Cultures of Cities, 1995)

###### What is liminality?
Uses liminality more **implicitly**—through analysis of **power, culture, and control** in urban public space. Emphasizes **social and political tensions** in spaces that appear public but are regulated.

What is a liminal space?
Focuses on **contested urban public spaces**: parks, plazas, waterfronts, redeveloped neighborhoods spaces where **gentrification and privatization blur public/private lines**

What are the key theoretical concerns?
Concerned with how **power and capital** shape public space. Liminality arises when spaces are **open in appearance but exclusive in function**, often driven by **commodification** and **cultural displacement**.

What is the impact of such place on social behaviour and control?
Liminality exists in **tensions between control and freedom**. Public spaces are increasingly **privately managed**, restricting genuine democratic participation.

What is the meaning of a liminal space?
Emphasizes **symbolic conflict**—spaces caught between **authenticity and commodification**, **access and exclusion**. They are ambiguous not by nature, but due to **conflicting interests**.

##### - What elements make a physical public space liminal?

###### A liminal space according to Rob shields:
(Places on the Margin: Alternative Geographies of Modernity - Rob Shields 1991)

Rob Shields, a sociologist and cultural theorist, develops the concept of **liminal space** by applying anthropological ideas to urban environments and public culture. Drawing from Victor Turner’s work on rites of passage, Shields explores how **certain public spaces become “in-between” zones** which are neither here nor there. Its a zone where identities, norms, and meanings are temporarily suspended or blurred.

 “Liminal spaces are marginal in the sense that they lie between, or on the boundary of, more clearly defined territories. They are zones of possibility where the norms of behavior, identity, and meaning are suspended or open to contestation.”  **Rob Shields, _Places on the Margin_ (1991, p. 96)**

 According to Rob Shields, a public space is liminal when it:

1. **Exists in an “in-between” state**  
    It’s neither fully public nor private, settled nor unsettled. Such spaces interrupt clear spatial or social classifications.
    
2. **Is transitional in function**  
    People pass through these spaces rather than settle in them, examples are airports, highways, or border zones.  They are **“spaces of passage”**, not destinations.
    
3. **Suspends or challenges normative behaviors**  
    Liminal public spaces often foster **anomalous or alternative social behaviors**, where conventional rules may be relaxed or inverted (e.g., in festivals or protests).
    
4. **Holds unstable or ambiguous meanings**  
    Liminal spaces are **“ambiguous, indeterminate”** and often evoke unease or creativity due to their lack of fixed identity.
    
5. **Creates potential for transformation**  
    These spaces enable experimentation with identity, belonging, or power. They are stages where transformation can occur.

Uncanny valley

Its premise is that psychosocial existence is not made of ‘stuff’ like building blocks, but of happenings and events in which the many elements that compose our lives are temporarily drawn together.

##### What is the difference between liminality and liminoid?

In essence, liminality is like being on a guided tour through a specific transition, while liminoid is like going on an adventure where you get to choose your own path.
