### DEFINITIONS
#### "Liminal"
- *Between or belonging to two different places, states, etc.* - Cambridge Dictionary

- *Liminal is a formal word most often used to describe an intermediate state, phase, or condition. It can also describe something that is barely perceptible or barely capable of eliciting a response.*  - Merriam webster

- *(etymology) From latin "līmen" meaning "threshold", first recorded in 1890s.* 
- *(psychology) relating to, or situated at the limen, the threshold at which a stimulus begins to produce an effect.*
- *relating to a transitional or intermediate state, stage, or period.*
	- - Dictionary.com

- ==*Liminality signifies a threshold between two zones, an anteroom distinct from that which could be said to be definitely inside or outside, here and there.*== - Landscapes of Liminality paper (pdf below)

#### "Space"
- *an empty place* 
- *the area around everything that exists, continuing in all directions*
	- - Cambridge Dictionary

- *the unlimited or incalculably great three-dimensional realm or expanse in which all material objects are located and all events occur.* - Dictionary.com

- ==*The ideas “space” and “place” require each other for definition. From the security and stability of place we are aware of the openness, freedom, and threat of space, and vice-versa. Furthermore, if we think of space as that which allows movement, then place is pause; each pause in movement makes it possible for location to be transformed into place.*==
	- - Yi-Fu Tuan in Space & Place (via Landscapes of Liminality)


#### "Liminal Space" = Three dimensional transitional place 
- - my own interpretation

#### "Liminal Space" = Spatial act of transitioning
- - Van Gennep via Landscapes of Liminality
#### *"==Liminal spaces are those which are, simultaneously, place and space. They are familiar, yet unknown; they are secure, and yet intimidating.==" 
- - Landscapes of Liminality


### LITERATURE STUDY: Landscapes of Liminality
#### abstract:
Landscapes of Liminality expands upon existing notions of spatial practice and spatial theory, and examines more intricately the contingent notion of “liminality” as a space of “in-between-ness” that avoids either essentialism or stasis. **It capitalises on the extensive research that has already been undertaken in this area, and elaborates on the increasingly important and interrelated notion of liminality within contemporary discussions of spatial practice and theories of place.** Bringing together international scholarship, the book offers a broad range of cross-disciplinary approaches to theories of liminality including literary studies, cultural studies, human geography, social studies, and art and design. The volume offers a timely and fascinating intervention which will help in shaping current debates concerning landscape theory, spatial practice, and discussions of liminality.

#### Thoughts based on Landscapes of Liminality:
Space = limits, borders = closed/closing
Liminal = unfolding, becoming = open/opening
- Contradiction!

Liminal space = living in between

*"The project of limning the liminal is especially well suited to literature, which is the form most closely associated with the faculty of the imagination."* 
- We need to keep triggering imagination! Don't overexplain, no literalness.

*"==place is security, space is freedom: we are attached to one, and yearn for the other=="* - Yi-Fu Tuan
- place: herkenbaarheid geeft zekerheid
- space: geographical uncertainty geeft gelijktijdig een gevoel van vrijheid en dreiging.

*"The identity of a place does not derive from some internalized history. The identities of places are unfixed. The social relations are by their very nature dynamic and changing"
- het verhaal komt van de sociale relaties die aan de plek hangen: des te meer interessant om voor een sociaal geladen locatie te gaan voor long term project. (eg klooster)
*"human conceptions of place and space may be dependent on the relationships between real and imagined topographies or spatialities—between the geophysical environment and the human cognition or interpretation of that environment."

*"“Liminality” has been utilised as some thing of a catch-all expression for an ambiguous, transitional, or interstitial spatiotemporal dimension, and critical discourse often plays fast and loose with the term’s descriptive terminology, while sliding away from precise definitions."*
- ==Geen harde definitie. De vaagheid van liminal is precies wat het interessant en breed inzetbaar maakt.==
"*Liminality has been likened to a whole host of subject-positional categories, from “death, to being in the womb, to invisibility, to darkness, to bisexuality, to the wilderness, and to an eclipse of the sun or moon”."*
- The in-between

"*In essence, the study of liminality poses to us the problems of categorisation and the limitations of language in defining not only geophysical space and/or place, but conceptual, emotional, spiritual, and metaphysical spatial dynamics."
- Legt de vinger op waarom wij ons hiervoor fascineren, maar ook waardoor (laat ik voor mijzelf spreken) waarom ik unsure was over waar dit heen moest.

Liminal could be interpreted as micro-religious. Active in ceremonies and packed with tension both positive and negative. Rituals. Rites of passage. (Van Gennep + Victor Turner)
- wederom goeie reden voor klooster.

"*To speak of space was thus to speak of how space was occupied—and by whom—and the ways in which space in turn affected and determined the behaviour of those who occupied it, passed through it, and interacted with it.*"
- Reasoning behind wanting traces of life

*“==liminal moments== are marked by a dissipation of coherence as one state dissolves into another”*

"*As it operates within contemporary academic discourse, liminality, we contend here, is the interdisciplinary, cross-cultural, trans-geographical language of time, or, to be more precise, it is the language through which the passage of time is made coherent and identifiable.*"

"*Thomassen further reminds us that “liminality explains nothing”; liminality is; it happens, and it takes place.45 It is in itself something to be observed, rather than something to be utilised.*"
- observing instead of utilising

"*some of the links that can be found between liminal spaces and liminal figures*"
- Liminal figures: such as refugees and the homeless, tourists, travellers/Romani -> enige logische personen in liminal spaces?

### RANDOM THOUGHTS
"Limn the liminal" - funny

We zijn voorbij de eerste wave obsessie met liminality en liminal spaces. Belangrijk voor ons is de relevatie vinden voor deze tijd.
- Connectie Smooth City René Boer? Homogenisering van architectuur wereldwijd. Liminal spaces zijn vaak smooth en render-like, ietswat levenloos. Alsof het constant bijgehouden wordt, maar niet echt geleefd wordt. 
"“sens(ing) the simultaneous presence of everywhere in the place where
you are standing31”. - Massey
Everything is, in other words, fundamentally interconnected, but in ways that are (as with the distinctions between space and place explored above) potentially as alienating and disorienting as they are liberating and euphoric—a “both/and” state of affairs that is the essence of the liminal."

"Entre-deux" = interspace, gap
